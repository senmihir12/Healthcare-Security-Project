üè• Healthcare Security Data Analytics using MySQL
üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes a Healthcare Security Dataset sourced from Kaggle using MySQL Workbench. The dataset focuses on healthcare institutions, patient vitals, and diseases, while also integrating blockchain logs for secure transaction tracking and optimization metrics for system performance evaluation.

The project demonstrates how SQL-based analytics can be applied to healthcare + blockchain-integrated systems, with emphasis on:

Healthcare data evaluation

Blockchain transaction status analysis

Optimization and performance monitoring

üìÇ Dataset Description

The project uses three CSV files, imported as separate MySQL tables:

healthcare_data

Contains hospital, patient, and disease-related information

Key attributes:

Hospital_ID, Patient_ID, Age, Gender, Blood_Pressure, Glucose, Heart_Rate, Cholesterol and Diagnosis_Label

blockchain_logs

Logs related to healthcare blockchain transactions

Key attributes:

Block_ID, Timestamp, Client_ID, Model_Update_Hash, ECDSA_Signature, Transaction_Type and Status

optimization_metrics

Performance and resource allocation metrics

Key attributes:

Round, Client_ID, Local_Epochs, Data_Size_MB, Latency_ms, Bandwidth_Mbps, Aggregation_Time_ms and Resource_Allocation_Score

üîë SQL Concepts & Techniques Used

The project leverages a range of SQL functionalities for deeper insights:

Joins ‚Äì Linking healthcare, blockchain, and optimization tables for integrated analysis

CASE statements ‚Äì Categorizing patient vitals into buckets (e.g., BP ranges, Glucose levels)

Aggregate Functions ‚Äì AVG(), STDDEV(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN() for summary insights

Filtering with WHERE ‚Äì Analyzing subsets of patients, transactions, or performance metrics

Timestamps ‚Äì Extracting and analyzing time-based trends in blockchain logs

Performance Metrics ‚Äì Evaluating system efficiency based on latency, bandwidth, and aggregation times

üìä Example Analysis Performed

Average glucose level of patients grouped by disease

Standard deviation of heart rate across hospitals

Categorization of blood pressure readings (Normal, Pre-hypertension, Hypertension)

Blockchain transaction success vs. failure rates over time

Correlation of resource allocation score with data size and latency

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

MySQL Workbench ‚Äì SQL querying and schema design

Kaggle Dataset ‚Äì Source of healthcare, blockchain, and optimization data

CSV Import ‚Äì Loading structured data into MySQL

üöÄ How to Use

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/senmihir12/Healthcare-Security-Project.git


Import the CSV files into MySQL as separate tables:

healthcare_data

blockchain_logs

optimization_metrics

Run the SQL scripts provided in the repository to perform analysis.

üìå Key Learnings

Integration of healthcare + blockchain data in SQL workflows

Practical use of SQL joins, case statements, and aggregations

Application of performance and optimization metrics in healthcare security
